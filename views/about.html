        <p>As patriarch of the eponymous family, Homer and his wife Marge have three children: Bart, Lisa and Maggie. As
            the family's provider, he works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant as safety inspector. Homer embodies
            many American working class stereotypes: he is crude, overweight, incompetent, lazy, selfish, balding,
            clumsy, dim-witted, hot-tempered, childish, and addicted to beer, junk food and watching television.
            However, he often tries his hardest to be a decent man and is fiercely devoted to his family, especially
            when they need him the most.
